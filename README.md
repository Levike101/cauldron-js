# Cauldron.js - Minecraft Server in your browser

`Cauldron.js` allows you to run a minecraft server mainly from your browser.

It still uses a NodeJS backend server that hosts the minecraft server but all work will be performed inside the browser.

## Why?
By moving all processing and memory intensive work to the browser, `Cauldron.js` can be hosted on minimal server hardware while still allowing possibly hundreds of minecraft servers to be runnning on a single server.

## Why not?
1. Moving all processes into the browser requires the whole server code to be rewritten. 

    This is why `Cauldron.js` is still very bare-bones, having only a few elemental features and serving as a proof-of-concept.

2. Moving all processes into the browser also slows down the server ping.

    This results in actions sometimes needing up to one second to get to the other clients.

## Usage
Try a demo of `Cauldron.js` on <...> or [install it on your own server](#Installation).

## Installation

1. Clone this project
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vantezzen/cauldron-js.git
   ```
2. Use `yarn` to install its dependecies
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the server
   ```
   yarn start
   ```
4. Open the webpage in your browser (`127.0.0.1:3000` by default, the port will be printed in the console)
5. You will now see your minecraft server IP and port. Connect to the server in your minecraft client.

## Environment variables
When starting `Cauldron.js` you can set the following environment variables:
- DEBUG : Debug level for the NodeJS `debug` module (only for backend)
- LOCATION : IP/domain the servers are availible at. If no supplied, `Cauldron.js` will use the NodeJS `ip` module to get the current server IP.

## Developing
`Cauldron.js` uses Webpack to bundle its frontend. Please open a new terminal and run `yarn watch` to start webpack and listen for changes.

`Cauldron.js` uses the following folder structure:
```
/
    client/     // Client/frontend files
        dist/   // Files generated by webpack
        js/     // Main server files
    index.js    // Backend server
```

When developing `Cauldron.js` you might want to change its debug behaviour. `Cauldron.js` uses the npm `debug` module to debug both the front- and backend. To change the backend debug behaviour, set the `DEBUG` [environment variable](#Environment-variables), to change the frontend debug behaviour, set `localStorage.debug`. 

All of `Cauldron.js`'s modules will debug into the `cauldron:*` channel.
