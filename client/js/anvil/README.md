# Cauldron.JS Anvil storage provider

This module is a fork of the [prismarine-provider-anvil](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-provider-anvil), modified to work with BrowserFS. This allows minecraft worlds to be saved into the browser and later be exported into a regular minecraft save folder.
